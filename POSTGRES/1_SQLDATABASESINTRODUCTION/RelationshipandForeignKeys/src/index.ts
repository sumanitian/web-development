/*
Notes:
1. This code implements a basic signup API using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
2. The 'users' table stores user information like username, email, and password.
3. The 'addresses' table stores address details and references the 'users' table via a foreign key.
4. Proper error handling is implemented to ensure a response is sent even when an error occurs.
5. For better security, passwords should be hashed before storing them in the database.
6. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information like database connection strings.
