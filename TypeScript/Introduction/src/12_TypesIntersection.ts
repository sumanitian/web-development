/* Notes:
    - Intersection means combining two types together.
    - In TypeScript, the `&` operator is used to combine two types, creating an intersection. 
    - This means the resulting type (in this case, `TeamLead`) must have all the properties from both `Employee` and `Staff` types. 
    - In this example, the `teamLead` object has properties from both the `Employee` (name, startDate) 
      and `Staff` (name, department) types. Therefore, a `TeamLead` must have all of these properties 
      to be valid, meaning it must have `name`, `startDate`, and `department`.
