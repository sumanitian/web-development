/*
 * Notes:
    The basic difference between an abstract class and an interface is that an abstract class can have default implementations, 
    whereas an interface does not have this property. 
 * An abstract class can contain both abstract methods (which must be implemented by derived classes) 
 * and concrete methods (with default behavior / default implementation). 
 * On the other hand, an interface only defines method signatures without providing any implementation.

/* 

    1. Implementing interfaces (types vs interface).

    - You can implement interface in a class but you cannot do in type.
    - Types let you do unions and intersection but interface can let you do.

/* 
    2. Abstract classes vs interfaces.
    If a class can implement an interfaces

    What is the point of an abstract class ?


    Abstract class can have default implementation as well and interface cannot.
